# Lattice Boltzmann Project

This is the repository for all LB basic code I use in other projects. Its main purpose is to allow me to focus on the developing better Lattice Boltzmann code, while not interfering with other projects main developing objectives

## Notes on Programming Languages
This project was built primary on C++ and CUDA. C++ was used primarily to make small, day to day developments, and test its functionality. CUDA is intended for simulating bigger systems, and obtaining results. Just for fun I've included a Lattice-Boltzmann developed in FORTRAN, but It's not my priority to 
reproduce results using it.

Programming languages are divided by folders, and each one of them has 
a different README with its respective compilation guide.
